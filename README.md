# Sorting-Visualizer

In our project we have used HTML to make the body of our application, CSS to style our application and JavaScript to provide functionality to our application. With the help of JavaScript we have generated the random array of fixed size and then, with JavaScript and HTML we have converted the values in the array into bars, where length of each bar is determined by the value at that particular index. 

In JavaScript there is a setimeout function, which calls the particular function only after some particular time which is passed as an argument to the setimeout function. Now we have written the recursive code for each algorithm and when the algorithm reaches to the last line inside the function then we call that function again with the help of setimeout function and when some termination condition of recursion come we simply clear that timeout. 
When any algorithm runs, it runs in one go, means that it takes negligible time to complete and there is no time between any of the two steps, so these algorithm cannot give the proper visualization for the given algorithm but with the help of this we have added the delay between the series of steps required to sort the array with sorting algorithm which we have used in our project.
